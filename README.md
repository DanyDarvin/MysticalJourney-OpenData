"Mystical Journey : The First Step"  - demo prototype is a small, interactive sample of the upcoming 3D adventure game. The demo will give players a taste of the game's gameplay.

Players will be able to explore a small section of the game's world. They will also get a chance to meet some of the game's main characters and learn more about the world they'll be exploring in the full game.

The demo will be available for free on our website and on various gaming platforms. It will be a great way to generate buzz and excitement for the full game, and to give players a chance to experience the magic of the Mystical Realms before the full game is released.
